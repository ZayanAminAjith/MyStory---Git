Peter was in a lab, when a spider landed on him and bit him. He went home after that and felt dizzy. He went to sleep, and when he woke up he could see without his glasses and got superstrong.
He has got powers. He could shoot web from his hands, had better healing. Then he made a suit so no one will know his secret identity.
He fought bad guys. And saved the world from monsters.
